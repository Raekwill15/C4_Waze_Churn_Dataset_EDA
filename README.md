# Exploratory Data Analysis and Report on Waze User Churn w/ PACE Framework

This repository contains my work on an assignment given at the end of the 3rd course 
in the 7-course Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The assignment 
shows off my ability to **explore new data sets, clean data, create visualizations from data, evaluate
visualizations and statistics and report the results** for readers coming from a non-technical background.

Background on the assignment is that I'm a Data Analyst working at Waze (The gps / driving application) and 
part of my job is to analyze last months user data to find trends and patterns in users who stop using the app
vs users who continue to use the app. In this course the focus is **data cleaning, visualizations and statistics** 
gained from the data.

The Notebook contains my work and the executive summary is a summary that would be presented to my manager or stakeholders
so that they can understand the findings from my **exploratory analysis**. This is only the begining of completeing the full task. 
In later courses we start using **predictive machine learning models** to determine if a user will churn or not based on their 
user data.
